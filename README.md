Hello There! I'm Frank, one of the 3 goobers working on this little squidgame (Yes, I think we're funny). Kinda starting out as just a passion project for me 
and Sam, we're both just two peoeple looking to get a good footing right now in the CS field, and we thought it'd be fun to make a game in Lua, so here we are.

Both of us have some game dev knowledge (Sam significantly more than me), and I have a deep love for Pico-8, so that's just kinda where we're at. It's also a great opportunity
to learn lua as well (bomb ass language, more places should use it!) Anyways, if you've got Pico-8 (you should definitely consider it, it's free!), and you're looking to see some of 
our work, come check it out!
